Exercise 2.12

We are told that "a" is to the back of "b", so we can tell that "b" is to the front of "a", 
since "front of" and "back of" are inverses.
We are also told that "a" is in front of "c", 
so "c" must be to the back of "a" for the same reason written as before.
Knowing that "a" is to the front of "c" and "b" is to the front of "a",
"b" must be to the front of "c".
This is our desired conclusion.
