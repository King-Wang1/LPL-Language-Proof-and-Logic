Exercise 2.13


We are told that "a" has the same size as "b".

We also know that "a" is larger than "c", so "b" is also bigger that "c".

Furthermore we know that "d" is smaller than "c", so "c" is bigger that "d".

We can confirm that "b" is bigger that "c", who is bigger than "d", 
so "b" must be bigger than "d". 

In conclusion, "d" is smaller than "b" knowing that smaller and bigger are inverses.

This is our desired conclusion.
